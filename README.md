In the early days of computer networking, data transmission proved difficult, because in order for one computer to understand another, sets of rules were needed. Initially, they were implemented in the application programs only for the respective purpose of use - with the disadvantage that this program had to be adapted to the existing network technology and the application program on the opposite side or sides. This meant that often only the same systems were compatible with each other, which was also used by manufacturers to encourage customers to purchase more of their products. With constant new developments and the size of the networks, however, their heterogeneity also increased, so that the demand for universally applicable technology and program selection became more and more prevalent. As a result, modularized protocols were developed by computer manufacturers in the late 1970s and in the 1980s, which from then on were considered transmission standards in closed computer networks.

In 1968, at the behest of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), experiments were conducted by the government research agency ARPA to gain fundamental knowledge about how computer networks work. As a practical result, the ARPANET project was launched in 1969 to enable the transparent transmission of data between different subscriber systems - regardless of the route, medium or circumstance of the transmission. By 1983, the ARPANET had established the Internet protocol family as a collection of interrelated standards of reliable, high-performance data transmission. It is also used after ARPANET became available to the public as the Internet, and is considered a quasi-standard for many network applications due to the fact that many computers have been connected to the Internet since the 2000s at the latest.
